# Skittles Ticket Tracer
## backstory
Originally a Greasemonkey user script, and eventially firefox extension, this project converts the old greasemonkey script to AngularJS (and some JQuery), with some formal structure and utilizing some techniques I've learned recently like mock data/services, promises, etc.

The project is an attempt to make an old ticket tracker more usable for me.

I had called it skittles because of all the large colorful buttons and the badges.  

## design goals
The primary goal, increase the usability.  All data is presented as a user drills into the tickets.  

A secondary goal to use a minimal color design.  Using only white and grays; only using colors to highlight  focus, like buttons ticket status, etc.

The design is a 3 panel design.  Far left panel general aggregation of the tickets, the middle panel details the far left selected item and the 3rd right panel detail the selected ticket.
